# File Renaming Script

This Python script renames all files in a given directory, ordering them by numbers (e.g., `1.txt`, `2.png`, etc.) while preserving their original file extensions. The script takes the directory path as an argument and processes all files inside that directory.

## Features
- Automatically orders files by numbers.
- Preserves the file extensions.
- Can be applied to any directory by providing it as an argument.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed by running:
   ```bash
   python3 --version


## Usage
1.	Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
2.	Run the script by providing the path to the directory containing the files you want to rename.
    ```bash
    python rename_files.py /path/to/your/directory

## Output Example
    ```bash
    Renamed: oldfile1.txt -> 1.txt
    Renamed: image.png -> 2.png
    Renamed: document.pdf -> 3.pdf
